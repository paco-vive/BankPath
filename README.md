# BankPath – The BBVA App to Create, Formalize, and Bank Microbusinesses in Mexico

**BankPath** is an innovative mobile app designed to guide informal micro-entrepreneurs in Mexico through a 5-step journey to formalization and banking with BBVA.

**Winner of 2nd Place at Swift Changemakers Hackathon 2025 – BBVA Challenge (Guadalajara)**  
This project was recognized for its impact and innovation in promoting financial inclusion through technology.

In a country where over **90% of 5 million microbusinesses are informal** and only **20% are banked** ([INEGI, 2024](https://www.inegi.org.mx/contenidos/saladeprensa/aproposito/2024/EAP_MIPYMES24.pdf)), BankPath empowers users like street vendors, store owners, and artisans to overcome fear of bureaucracy and access the formal economy — all from their phones.
